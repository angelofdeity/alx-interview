## 0x02-minimum_operations

This problem is easily solved (with math) by returning the sum of its prime factors. The
prime factors of a number are the prime numbers that multiply together to make
that number. For example, the prime factors of 12 are 2, 2, and 3. The prime
factors of 15 are 3 and 5.

The prime factors of a number can be found by dividing the number by the
smallest prime number that divides evenly into the number. For example, the
smallest prime number that divides evenly into 12 is 2. 12 / 2 = 6. The
smallest prime number that divides evenly into 6 is 2. 6 / 2 = 3. The smallest
prime number that divides evenly into 3 is 3. 3 / 3 = 1. The prime factors of
12 are 2, 2, and 3.
